# User_Management

This project is a simple user management application that allows users to add, edit, update, and delete user details. 
The application interacts with a mock API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to simulate backend operations.

Steps to run :

1.Clone the repository.
2.Install dependencies.
3.Start the development server.
4.Open the browser and navigate to the local host.

Challenges Faced:

During development, we encountered a challenge when updating existing user details. The issue arose due to incorrect validation logic that caused form submission to fail even when the input was valid. After debugging, the issue was resolved by ensuring proper validation and state management before sending the update request.


Possible Improvements:
If given more time, the following improvements could be made:

1.Implementing a proper backend for persistent data storage.
2.Enhancing the UI with better styling and user experience improvements.
3.Implementing pagination and search functionality to improve usability.
